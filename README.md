React is a declarative component base state driven JS library for building user interfaces. Declarative in the sense that we tell react what a component should look like base on the data/ current state using a declarative syntax called JSX

#Components, instances and react elements

A component is a javascript function that returns react elements usually written as JSX. It is blueprint or template
Instances are created when we "use"Â  the component. Using a component in our code react then creates instances of the component.
Each instance holds it's own state and props and has it's own lifecycle

Diffing notes

Diffing is comparing elements step by step between two renders based on their position in the tree

Diffing assumptions

2 elements with different types will produce different trees

elements with a stable key prop stay the same between renders

considerations

same position different element --> react destroys and removes from the DOM the initial element, its children including state. Tree might be rebuilt if children stays the same (state is reset)

same position same element-->element would be kept including its children and also state. new props/attributes are passed if they change between renders. want to create a brand new component with new state then use the key props

the key props helps us tell the diffing algorithm that an element is unique. it allows react to distinguish multiple component instances of the same component type from the other instances
When a key stays the same across renders the element would be kept in the DOM even if the position in the tree changes eg using keys in lists
If the key changes between renders the element would be destroyed and a new one created even if the position in the tree is the same as before eg using keys to reset state
Use cases
in lists (key stays the same between renders)
using key prop to reset state (key changes between renders)
If you need to reset state make sure your give the element a key and the key changes between renders
summary: use key prop when you have multiple child elements of the same type


side effects are basically any interaction between a react component and the outside world. can also be thought of as a code that does something eg data fetching, subscription setup, setting timers or manually accessing the DOM
Effects exists not just to run code at different lifecycle points but to keep a code synchronised with some external system
